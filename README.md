🧠 Project Vision

This portfolio is intentionally built without heavy UI frameworks to demonstrate:

Deep understanding of Vue 3 Composition API

Clean reactive state management

SVG-based animation systems

Scalable component architecture

Performance-first frontend engineering

The focus is clarity, polish, and intentional design — not template-driven UI.
